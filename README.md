The unusual and uncontrollable cell growth in the brain is referred to as Brain Tumour. Brain 
tumours cause more pressure inside the skull as they take up the restricted space in the skull. 
The brain is surrounded with bones of the skull, which means it cannot inflate further to make 
space for the unusual cell growth which results in the unusual cells squashing the normal 
brain tissues which leads to life-threatening complications.
To detect the unusual cell growth 
and malformed cells in the brain, MRI or Magnetic Resonance Imaging is used. This process 
uses magnetic fields to construct an image of the body part under question. This method can 
also be used to categorize the tumour as being as being primary or secondary which helps in 
further treatment procedure. This project experimentally analyses supervised machine learning 
algorithms that are used to detect brain tumours in MRI images and presents the results in a 
creative UI application.
